# AREBO

Respository containing analysis files for the AREBO project.

## JRATE Simulations.
The following three notebooks contain the code for results presented in the JRATE paper on the design and optimization of AREBO's kinematic structure.

[**AREBO_Simulation.ipynb**](https://github.com/siva82kb/AREBO/blob/master/notebooks/AREBO_Simulation.ipynb)
Contains an interactive simulation for visualizing the structure AREBO's open kinematic chain, and the human robot-closed kinematic chain.

[**AREBO_Optimization.ipynb**](https://github.com/siva82kb/AREBO/blob/master/notebooks/AREBO_Optimization.ipynb)
Contains the code for the numerical optimization performed for finding the optimal link lengths for the robot.

[**AREBO_HumanLimb_Estimation.ipynb**](https://github.com/siva82kb/AREBO/blob/master/notebooks/AREBO_HumanLimb_Estimation.ipynb)
Contains the code for the simulation analysis performed for evaluating the performance of the proposed algorightm for estimating the human limb parameters.

### Instruction to run this code.
The code was developed using Python 3.

Download or clone the folder to your local machine. The notebooks for [optimization](https://github.com/siva82kb/AREBO/blob/master/notebooks/AREBO_Optimization.ipynb) and [estimation procedure](https://github.com/siva82kb/AREBO/blob/master/notebooks/AREBO_HumanLimb_Estimation.ipynb) require the [progressbar](https://pypi.org/project/progressbar/) module, which will need to installed before running the notebooks.

The [AREBO simulation](https://github.com/siva82kb/AREBO/blob/master/notebooks/AREBO_Simulation.ipynb) notebook will only run on jupyter notebook and not in jupyter lab. 

**Note**: In order to save space, the folder opt_est and est_data do not contains the data that is generated by the noteboosk. You will need to run all the code in the notebooks for [optimization](https://github.com/siva82kb/AREBO/blob/master/notebooks/AREBO_Optimization.ipynb) and [estimation procedure](https://github.com/siva82kb/AREBO/blob/master/notebooks/AREBO_HumanLimb_Estimation.ipynb) to generate the data locally.
